# module-14

This was definetly one of the hardest homework assignemnts I have worked on.  I did rely on the solution to get me through this one. To esnsure I was not just blindly copying I had to watch the lectures and ask chatgpt what some lines of code meant to ensure that I fully understood what was happening.  Imporitng the JSON was not that hard since I did something similar for project 3.
